## Bullying & Harassment in U.S. Schools: Data Visualization Dashboard

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores bullying and harassment trends in U.S. schools using interactive data visualizations. It provides insights into how different student demographicsâ€”such as race/ethnicity, disability status, and English language proficiencyâ€”experience bullying. The dashboard is built using Plotly for interactive charts and maps.
